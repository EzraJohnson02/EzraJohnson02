Hi, Iâ€™m Ezra Johnson. I am currently a freshman at the California Institute of Technology
studying computer science and math. This term, I am taking a class on software design in C to prepare
me to work on larger code bases. This summer, I will be working as a STEP intern at google to further
my development as a programmer.
